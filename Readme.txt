Instructions:

Create a front-end webapp for design professionals utilizing the provided mocks as reference.
The page should be responsive on mobile and tablet, translating from desktop design provided.
The data you need is provided in data.json. The images are provided for you in the images folder. 

Use sass or scss to create the styles.css as your external style sheet.

Use javascript and the provided JSON (data.json) to display all the dynamic content (text) within each section.

Optionally use a JS framework such as AngularJS, React or Backbone for data binding.

Use a bundler for CSS, JS compilation. 

Note: you do not need to create complex search functionality. A basic search is fine where you enter a designer name "sire design" and the information on the page changes.
